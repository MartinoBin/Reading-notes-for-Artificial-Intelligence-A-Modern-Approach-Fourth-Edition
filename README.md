# Reading-notes-for-Artificial-Intelligence-A-Modern-Approach-Fourth-Edition

Weekly summary report 1
I read 1.1 and 1.2 of chapter 1 (the 4th Global Edition). It discusses two questions: What is AI and what are the foundations of AI. The book has provided many basic concepts from the very beginning, such as the Turing test, automated reasoning, and machine learning. For someone like me who is new to this area, all the terms need to be read and studied carefully.  I have to say, it takes time.

In terms of the foundations of AI in 1.2, I'm particularly not familiar with the control theory and cybernetics.  This is not to say that I'm quite familiar with the other 7 foundations of course, but at least we could hear some words quite frequently mentioned from the daily environment. Therefore, I expect more discussion on this control theory topic.

One impression that I had when I was reading 1.2: it says philosophy is the first foundation of AI, then mathematics, then economics...etc. For me, the boundaries between these areas are not easy to distinguish, especially when it comes to the top of the interdisciplinary area, each case can be different, from a self-driving car to a customer service chat robot. It is interesting to read that linguistic and Noam Chomsky is mentioned. Comparing with the most important contributors in the other AI foundations, he seems to be the only one who is mentioned as a linguist. However, I always think he is a philosopher first, then a mathematician, and then a social activist. Therefore, I put a question mark on how syntax and grammar can help to shape some AI areas such as NLP (natural language processing).

Another thing I particularly found impressive, in 1.3.6 it says: '(from 1987 onwards) The brittleness of expert systems led to a new, more scientific approach incorporating probability rather than Boolean logic, machine learning rather than hand-coding, and experimental results rather than philosophical claims.'  (p.42) Making philosophical claims more than pursuing experiment results. This is exactly my impression of the modern 2020 linguists! Maybe this is why Chomsky is the only one who left can be mentioned in AI foundation as a linguist.  

In order to finish the first quizzes, I spent some time figuring out the relation between computer science, AI, machine learning, and deep learning. It is good to slow down and think about what exactly are they and what's the difference among them. I also read the elements of Ai online course part 1, but I'm still not sure, for example, what areas can be involved in driving a taxi in a real environment? I would say all. It depends on how complicated the product is supposed to be. So I think the questions are a little tricky in terms of how do we interpret them, or it needs to be more specific. Therefore I expect some clarification next lesson. I think I need to finish reading the entire 1.3 in order to have a general sense.

Some references seem not easy to find at the end of the book. For example, this Marvin Minsky (1969) in chapter 1.3 (p.35) seems not to list in the references. Did I miss something?

Around 10 hours.
